# Polar-Codes-BP-Decoding

- To run the code, run "runBP.m", which outputs the matching number of bits after decoding.
- Adjust parameters such as noise level in the first line of "runBP.m"

## Encoding
Using encoding method and paramters from the attached slides from Monash University.

## Decoding
BP inplementation. Propagates from left to right first and then from right to left. Not really working :(
